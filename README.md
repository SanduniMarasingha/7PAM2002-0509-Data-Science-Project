Project Title: Exploring Regional House Price Dynamics and Property Type Trends in the UK Housing Market

This repository contains code that has been developed to facillitate understanding and forecasting market conditions of UK housing. The primary goal is to study regional house price changes along with interproperty dynamics with the use of machine learning.

Code Overview:

This section presents an analysis of the regional house price trend in terms of property type and development of models to predict the house prices and how different variables influence them.

Input Format:

The input is a data set which consists of number of transactions of the month of a particular category of properties in the unit of the uk. It has fields such as property type (i.e. flat, detached house, semi detached house), sale price, county, area, postcode, transaction date, etc.

Output Format:

The output includes includes but not limited to visualizations (graphs of average house prices over time, bar graphs to show the change of house prices over time), summary statistics, model estimates of the expected future house prices.

Function Parameters:

Functions in the code usually need parameters such as:

data: This is the core data that will provide information about the houses in the area.

region: Performing similar analysis for specific region.

property_type: The type of property for which the analysis is carried out e.g. flat, terraced.

model_params: These will be the parameters for which the prediction models will be adjusted eg: ARIMA, OLS regression.across various regions and property types in the UK.
